# Stylesora

Stylesora is a CSS package built on [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) and [tailwind-ui](https://tailwindui.com/components). Along with these core packages, Stylesora also includes helpful patterns built with [tailwinds directives](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives), which allows for faster prototyping and less class declarations.
