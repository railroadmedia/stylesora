# Search 

Search enables user to specify a word or a phrase to find relevant content without using the primary or secondary navigation. Search can be used as
the primary means of discovering content, or as an aid while using the primary and secondary navigation systems. 

## Search Fields

Search firlds set the users conteext for the search with placeholder text. The text should pertain to the page or section the search box is in. In most 
cases the word "Search" will occupy the search field but this can change depending on the scenario. Consider using suggestive microcopy when possible. 

The search field's height and width can be adjusted to fit different scenarios. There is no standard size for search fields.

## Standard Search Fields

search icon can either have no background color or the corresponding brand background color.

## Recent Search And Autocorrect

The default state for this search is the standard search bar. Clicking inside the search bar brings users to the focus state. Users can then view their
recent searches and begin typing their query. As the user begins to type the recent search dropdown turns into the autocorrection dropdown. Users
can return to the default state by deleting their current query or pressing the 'X' within the search.
