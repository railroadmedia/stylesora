# Iconography

Musora mainly uses [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) 5.14.0 designed by the FontAwesome team for its standard icon set. Musora uses flaticon.com and has several
custom icons made by our in-house design team. The icons in this design system are embedded SVG icons and can be scaled, coloured and adjusted to your
specific needs.
