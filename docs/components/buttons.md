# Buttons

These are the default buttons for all Musora brands. All primary and secondary buttons should use their corresponding primary brand colors. Tertiary
buttons are typically white (#FFFFFF) but in some cases can be grey (#8C9698) or black (#000000). The default height of each button is 50px but can be
adjusted depending on the scenario. The default length is dermined by the text and icons included within each button.

Buttons are used to initialize an action. Button labels should express the action that will occur when clicked.
