# Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs area a navigation system used to show users their current location relative to the information architecture. Breadcrumbs allow users to
quickly move up or down to a parent level. Breadcrumbs are effective in situations that have a large amount of content organized in a hierachy of 
more that two levels. 

Breadcrumbs are treated as a secondary navigation only. They should never entirely replace the primary navigation. They also should not be use on a
single level experience.

## Long Breadcrumbs

When a breadcrumb contains more than 6 items, the breadcrumb auto-collapses while using ellipses to indicate more information. Users can expand
the breadcrumb by clicking on the elipse icon between the first and last breadcrumb.
