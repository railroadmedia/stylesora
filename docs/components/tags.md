# Tags

Tags are used to categorize, organize and label items using keywords that describe the item. Single or multiple tags can be used to categorize items.
Tags should use short labels for easy scanning. Two word tags can be used when necessary to differentiate themselves from other tags.  

## Default Tag

The default tags for Musora are commonly used within the structured lists. These tags are light weight text, that describe specific details of the 
corresponding content.

## User Generated Tag

User generated tags allow users to apply their own unique tags to specific content. This is not currently a feature on the Musroa platforms but will be
implemented in future updates. 

<!-- Example -->

## Tag (Filter)

Tags can also be used to filter data or show users which filters have been applied. All tags used with the filtered data should include an option to
remove the tag.
